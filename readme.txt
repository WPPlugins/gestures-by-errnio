= Features =

Our main features include enhancement of the following gesture actions:

* **Scroll** - When users scroll your up or down page, we display recommended articles from your site to help increase site navigation. We do this by determining when they are done reading the articles, or are about to exit.
* **Swipe** - Left and right finger actions enable easy browsing of your site content, through a mobile friendly article gallery which promoted your site content. 
* **Tap** - Text selection actions, using the long tap gesture, trigger more information about the selected text, along with additional options to browse related content and search for relevant information. 
* **Zoom** - Zoom actions on your mobile site are enhanced with our zoom tool, which enable users to zoom images without distorting your site experience, and recommending other images in your article and site, along with added social features.


We also feature monetization options for selected publisher sites, with the following features:

* **Web Search** - a web search box is added to the top of the screen. An additional layer of content and recommended actions is added, labeled "top hits". This serves users with promoted actions and content helping you as a site owner looking to make profit from advertising, to earn revenue off exiting traffic in a seamless and unobtrusive way with no banners or ads.
* **Text Selection** - enhanced with a simple addition of promoted actions like search, share or related content. Much like our search offers, these promoted actions enable you as a site owner to add incremental revenue to the site with no banners or ads. 
* **Bottom bar** - An additional bottom bar is displayed to your site, providing options of browsing related content, sharing, quick links to popular exit sites, and a new tab to continue browsing with no ads.

= How it Works =

The **errnio plugin** reaches out to errnio servers and includes the errnio **gesture recognition code**. The gesture recognition code taps into your visitor gestures, performed on your site, and analyses which errnio engagement action or monetization unit will work effectively. errnio works with various 3rd party advertisers by connecting the right offers to the right gesture in the right context in and the right time - **ONLY** and **EXCLUSIVELY** within the errnio gesture functions. We never inject ads into your site!
Using the unique **errnio** plugin maximizes your full engagement and monetization potential on mobile web with no banners or taking any more of your site real-estate.
